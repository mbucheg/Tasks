## What is CNV/CNA? 
Copy Number Variations/Copy Number aberrations: specific sequence repeats in the genome that vary between individuals. It is a form of structural variation and can be important in cancer development and progression.
## How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?
Progenetix is a derived database, that provides mutation data in cancer, especially highlighting the focus on CNVs. The individual sample data is curated from multiple different sources, the majority coming from genomic arrays from SNP platforms
Up to date: there are 156871 samples from 906 different cancer types.

## Describe NCIt, ICDO, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
NcIt: National Cancer Institute thesaurus
ICDO:International Classification of Diseases in Oncology
UBERON: Uber-anatomy ontology 
## What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies and how to use them?

## What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
Application Programming Interfaces
"API: set of routines, protocols and tools that specifies how software components interact, to exchange data and processing capabilities" Source: BIO390:Lecture 1 
This is a way you can access databases.
## How does progenetix visualize CNA profiles?

## What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
