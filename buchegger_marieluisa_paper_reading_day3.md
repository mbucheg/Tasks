## What is CNV/CNA? 
Copy Number Variations/Copy Number aberrations: specific sequence repeats in the genome that vary between individuals. It is a form of structural variation and can be 
## How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?

## Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.

## What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies and how to use them?

## What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
Application Programming Interfaces
"API: set of routines, protocols and tools that specifies how software components interact, to exchange data and processing capabilities" Source: BIO390:Lecture 1 
This is a way you can access databases.
