# Exercise
## 1. Use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence
 • Which organism does this sequence belong to?
 • Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?
 • Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on 
the accession that you choose)
 • Is it DNA or RNA sequence?
 • Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)


## 2. Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence
 • Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID? 
• What protein does this sequence come from? 
• Which organism does this sequence belong to? 
• What is the function of this protein?
 • What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?
## 3. If you have more time, play around to feel the difference of blast service from different databases 
For example,
 • Use Blast in NCBI to query the protein sequence
 • Use Blast in Uniprot to query the nucleotide sequenc
