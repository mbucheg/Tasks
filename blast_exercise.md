# Exercise
## 1. Use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence
 • Which organism does this sequence belong to?
 Human
 "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/NJ-NYGC-NJ-BioR-411-Ampliseq/2020, complete genome"
 • Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?
 Accession number: PV005664.1
 max score: 6929
 query cover: 100%
 E value: 0.0
 • Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on the accession that you choose)
 • Is it DNA or RNA sequence? RNA
 • Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
Yes, a Spike glycoprotein

## 2. Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence
 • Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID? P01116
• What protein does this sequence come from? Ras protein
• Which organism does this sequence belong to?  Homo Sapiens (Human)
• What is the function of this protein? GTPase KRas, Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity. Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation.
 • What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?
 VAR_034601 -->G > GG
## 3. If you have more time, play around to feel the difference of blast service from different databases 
For example,
 • Use Blast in NCBI to query the protein sequence --> same result
 • Use Blast in Uniprot to query the nucleotide sequence --> same result
